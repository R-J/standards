# Vanilla's Coding Standards

This repo contains the Vanilla forums' coding standards utilities.

As [explained in our documentation](http://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/contributing/coding-standard/),
our codebase is being updated to follow our standards.
This is a long and ongoing process. Our codebase does not currently pass all the tests, 
but every new file added should!

You can use PHP_CodeSniffer to validate code using our coding standards.
See [Validating your PHP code with PHP_CodeSniffer](http://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/contributing/coding-standard/#validating-your-php-code-with-php-codesniffer)
from our documentation for more information.
