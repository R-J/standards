# Vanilla's coding standards

This repo contains the Vanilla forums' coding standards utilities.

As [explained in our documentation](http://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/contributing/coding-standard/),
our codebase it being updated to follow our standards. 
This is a long and ongoing process so our codebase does not currently pass all the tests but every new file added
should pass them!

To validate that some code meets our coding standards your can use PHP_CodeSniffer.
See [Validating your PHP code with PHP_CodeSniffer](http://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/contributing/coding-standard/#validating-your-php-code-with-php-codesniffer)
from our documentation for more information about it.
